# Lecture-October-10
Forecasting lecture. Lets say forecasting with an AR(1) but the true model is an Ar(4).
# Larger Models:
With larger model comes coefficient inefficinecy which is extrapolated into fute or forecast. 
- Consider 2 models:


  we obtain sequence of forecasts - FR1 anf FR1/FR2. The desireble is forecast errors with 0 mean and low variance.

Summary:

1. Larger Models and Coefficient Inefficiency: When dealing with larger models, such as AR(4) in comparison to AR(1), there can be challenges related to coefficient inefficiency.
2. Forecasting with Different Models: Consider two models: Model 1 (AR(1)) and Model 2 (AR(4)). Generate sequences of forecasts, denoted as FR1 and FR2, respectively.
3. Forecast Error Characteristics: The goal is to have forecast errors with a mean close to zero and low variance. Efficient forecasting models aim to minimize bias (mean forecast error) and variance of forecast errors.

Additional Considerations:
1. Model Selection:
Choosing the appropriate model involves a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. Larger models may capture more complex patterns but could lead to overfitting.
2. Forecast Evaluation:
It's crucial to evaluate the performance of different models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or others depending on the context.
3. Overfitting:
Larger models may be prone to overfitting, capturing noise in the data rather than true underlying patterns. This can result in poor out-of-sample forecasting performance.
4. Model Validation:
Validate models using out-of-sample data to ensure that the selected model generalizes well to new data.
In the context of ARIMA models, including AR(p) models, selecting the appropriate order (p) involves considering model diagnostics, residual analysis, and goodness-of-fit measures.

He is talking something and i dont understand a thing. I need my pills.
